# Self-Healing Infrastructure with Prometheus, Alertmanager & Ansible

By Guru Sahib Jiâ€™s grace tried for above project which was understood that if any resource or component of the project goes into failure state, based upon the alert and then triggering an action to be taken for the self healing purpose means to have our infrastructure of project continually run smoothly with event-driven automation, without manually starting failure resources again. Screenshots related to above project are added.
thanks
